# Further considerations, for even more fun:
#
# If it makes sense to consider fuzzy numbers (as is represented in the module
# by ``Infinite(0)`` for fuzzy over exclusive range -∞ .. ∞) and
# infinite numbers (yet of different orders), does it make sense then
# to consider fuzzy numbers over larger ranges?
#
# Then fuzzies have orders, the same as infinites.
# May they be asymmetrical? (seems yes, say for ``x = Fuzzy``,
# i.e. ``Infinite(0)``, i.e. ``fuzzy(-∞ >..< ∞)``,
# shouldn't ``x * x == fuzzy(0 ..< ∞)``, the same for ``abs(x)``?)
# (this kitten-face ``>..<`` being for exclusive-at-both-ends range)
#
# Should it be considered ``∞ / ∞ == Fuzzy``?
# Should it be considered ``Infinite(2) / Infinite(2) == fuzzy(2)``
# (the latter as a shortcut for ``fuzzy(Infinite(2) >..< Infinite(2))``)?
#
# How are they to be represented?
